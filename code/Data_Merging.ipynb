       " 'We chose Address Palace Downtown for our 20th wedding anniversary. It’s a hotel we already knew well, as we used to go to its gym when we lived in Dubai. The location is hard to beat — right in front of the Dubai Fountains, just a short walk to the Dubai Mall, ||We upgraded to a Junior Suite because the price was reasonable compared to other 5-star hotels in Downtown. The staff were nice and helpful, and breakfast had plenty of options, even if nothing really stood out. The hotel itself is stylish, though starting to feel a bit dated. We also had a great massage at the spa, which was a highlight. On the other hand, the in-room amenities (shampoo, shower gel, body cream, etc) felt quite basic for a hotel in this category.||What let us down was how little attention was given to our anniversary. We’ve celebrated special occasions in hotels all over the world, and there’s usually at least a thoughtful touch, flowers, a personalized card, or something to make the day feel noticed. Here, and only after I followed up to surprise my wife, the gesture was an impersonal pillow with two hearts. It was kind, but when paying almost USD 500 a night, we honestly expected more.||All in all, it’s a lovely hotel in an amazing location, and we enjoyed our stay. But for such a special occasion, it felt like a missed opportunity to make it truly memorable.',\n",

But honestly, the hotel made up for it with their great atmosphere and thoughtful service. The staff were warm and helpful, and we felt very well taken care of throughout our stay.\\n\\nOur suite was beautiful and super comfortable, and the location of the hotel is perfect for relaxing while still being close to everything. We also had a wonderful dinner at one of the hotel’s restaurants—it really made the night feel special.\\n\\nWe’d read about construction noise in other reviews, but we barely noticed anything. It was peaceful and relaxing the whole time.\\n\\nWe hope to come back again in the future, hopefully when the fountain is back! Even during renovations, it was a great experience.',\n",

       " 'We had breakfast buffet today at The St. Regis Dubai and it was an amazing experience.||The fresh fruits, especially the strawberries and pineapple, were delightful. The almond croissant, was absolutely delicious—I truly enjoyed it!||My brother was very impressed with the omelette prepared by Chef Maria. He mentioned that the ingredients were of excellent quality, and the inclusion of spinach was a rare and pleasant surprise. The omelette itself was incredibly soft, creamy, and flavorful—absolutely outstanding!||I also want to thank Chef Hakan, who was in charge, for ensuring such a high standard throughout the buffet, and Vaniga, the outlet manager, for the warm hospitality and excellent service.||I also ordered a matcha latte. The first one was a bit too milky for my taste, but thanks to Deepak’s special assistance, I received a richer version that perfectly matched my preference.||Overall, every staff member at The St. Regis—from the reception team to the servers—was friendly, attentive, and always ready to help. The hygiene standards were excellent as well; from the utensils and glasses to the restrooms, everything was spotless.||Highly satisfied and grateful for such a memorable experience!',\n",
       " 'We stayed for 2 nights in August with our 1 year old. We had a room on the 18th floor with wonderful views. We were blown away by our early check in and the service we received throughout our stay. The room was lovely and modern. We felt very comfortable and enjoyed a complimentary coffee from our butler on arrival. We were also celebrating our anniversary and had a special delivery of sweet treats and balloons - a lovely touch. We used the pool during our stay and felt very welcomed with our son. He was given a few small toys to play with and would like to thank Sohail for the great service he provided us with!  |We had the buffet breakfast on our second day. Best buffet breakfast we have ever had!|We enjoyed drinks on the second evening. We were disappointed that we were unable to use the bar on the ground floor due to having our son with us (it was also very quiet) we did however have drinks on the third floor and the cocktails were great. |The location of the hotel was great and if we are ever in Dubai again we would definitely visit!

Marina gave us the sweetest welcome - her smile and attention to detail made me feel truly special. Azim took care of us throughout the evening, making sure every preference was met. Honestly, one of the best experiences ever!!! I’ll be telling all my friends about this spot and the amazing team!',\n",

They both truly know how to make their guest feels special and they are both great assets to the hotel and manage their teams to really provide exceptional experiences.||We stayed in a suite and it was beautiful – very spacious, stylish, and comfortable with everything we needed. It really felt like a home away from home, but with that extra touch of luxury.||Breakfast was a real highlight each morning. There was a great variety to choose from and everything was fresh and delicious,  it was the perfect start to the day.|We also enjoyed spending time by the pool. It’s a relaxing space, never felt too crowded, and the service was excellent.||As for the location, it couldn’t have been better. Being on The Palm gave us amazing views and a peaceful atmosphere, but at the same time it was easy to get to the city’s main attractions.||Overall, our stay was memorable for all the right reasons and we would definitely return.

       " 'Stunning property, spacious and beautiful rooms, and outstanding service every step of the way! We came partially as an anniversary celebration, with our 9m old baby.

       " 'I regularly stay at the St. Regis during my trips to Dubai, and it continues to be a reliable and enjoyable choice. The location is one of its strongest advantages, with direct access to Nakheel Mall, making it easy to enjoy a wide variety of restaurants, cafés, and entertainment options without even leaving the property. In addition, excellent dining spots like Signor Sassi and SushiSamba are just next door, which adds even more convenience.\\n\\nThe service is consistently attentive and professional, and I also appreciate the thoughtful details throughout the hotel. A highlight for me is the reliable air-conditioning—always pleasantly cool, which makes a real difference during the intense summer heat. The amenities are also of high quality, adding to the overall comfort of the stay.\\n\\nBreakfast is another standout. When included in the room rate, it truly feels like a treat, offering one of the most impressive spreads I’ve seen in Dubai. From Mediterranean to Asian to Western selections, the variety caters to all tastes. I particularly value the consideration for dietary needs, with clear options for allergies and even a dedicated gluten-free section.\\n\\nThat said, there are a couple of areas that could be improved. The wall-mounted toilet flush button tends to get stuck, which can be inconvenient. Also, the wardrobe design isn’t ideal for longer clothing like dresses, abayas, or kandooras, as they don’t provide full-length hanging space.\\n\\nOverall, the St. Regis remains a top choice for me in Dubai—luxurious, convenient, and consistently well-run—with just a few small tweaks needed to make the experience even better.',\n",
       " \"We had such a fantastic stay at this hotel. We were greated by extremely friendly staff who were helpful when it came to checking in. |We booked a twin room which unfortunately wasn't avaliable for our stay even though we booked 6 months+ in advance. The receptionist was very helpful and upgraded our room due to the inconvenience (we were two friends travelling together, didn't particularly want to share a bed!) We were upgraded to a large King size room with great views of the estate, the bed was large enough so me and my friend were not close to eachother. |We were in the all inclusive package which I would suggest going for of you're visiting the hotel- drinks definetly rack up the bill so having all inclusive was perfect eventhough the all inclusive drinks menu was quite limited (two choices of beer and a handful selection of spirits and cocktails)|Would not recommend this hotel for families with young children. Whilst we enjoyed the music coming from wet deck, if we were with a family it would've been an inconvenience due to how loud the music was playing. |The in house buffet resturant Liv was a must visit during our stay, we never had the same food twice as there was so much selection and a rotation of dishes so it didn't get boring. The chef was excellent at catering for other tables specific needs and waiting staff were always friendly and chatty.|We spent most of our time at wet deck which had great vibes and attentive staff. Top tip, the beds that say 'promised' on are avaliable to anyone without a booking after 12pm so don't be afraid to ask/sit on the day beds! Did find it slightly disappointing that the events were not included in the all inclusive package. The pool definetly gets busy and has a party vibe on their Tuesday ladies days.|Overall a fantastic stay and cannot wait to go back! The personal touches really made the trip.\",\n",

The rooms are spotless, and the overall cleanliness of the hotel is excellent.\\n\\nNegative:\\nIn the evenings, especially during the peak season in August, the hotel is very boring; there are no entertainment programs, no animation, and zero beach activities. There’s nothing around to explore if you go outside, and it’s very far from the city center. The person checking the pool temperature enters the pool fully clothed, which is quite unprofessional. It’s a perfect hotel for the elderly, but I wouldn’t recommend it for young people.',\n",

The breakfast was superior to that of any other hotels I have visited in India, and the Bobby dosa was especially worth trying.

You can use the shuttle bus as a starting point for the big bus hop on hop off tour which is what I did. The shuttle was punctual, driven safely, and always had room. The Dubai mall’s food court is definitely worth checking out! But anyways, this hotel is definitively worth staying at!

       " \"Our stay at the Hyatt Centric Jumeirah Dubai was a mix of exceptional luxury and profound disappointment. While the hotel itself, along with the room and its service, lived up to every expectation of a five-star establishment, the dining experience was utterly subpar and tarnished our overall impression.\\n\\nThe hotel’s elegance is undeniable. The rooms are beautiful, and the service staff attending to them were nothing short of superb—friendly, efficient, and attentive. It truly felt like a premium experience, and we couldn't have been happier with our accommodation and the general atmosphere of the hotel.\\n\\nHowever, the dinner service was a catastrophic failure. The main issue was the à la carte menu, which featured a shockingly limited selection of only about six main courses. This menu never changed during our entire stay, making every meal a repetitive and boring affair. You were allowed one starter, one main, and one dessert, but the portions were so small that we frequently had to eat elsewhere to feel satisfied. This not only made our stay unnecessarily expensive but also incredibly frustrating.\\n\\nThe service in the restaurant was equally dreadful. It took an unacceptably long time for simple requests, like getting water, to be fulfilled. We constantly felt as though the waiters wanted us to leave as quickly as possible. We were dining as a group, and the moment one person finished their main course, a waiter would immediately rush to clear their plate and ask if they could bring dessert for the entire table—even for those who were still eating. This rushed, unprofessional behavior is far below the standards expected of a luxury hotel.\\n\\nIn summary, while the Hyatt Centric Jumeirah Dubai excels in its accommodations and general hotel service, the dining experience is a massive letdown. The limited, unchanging menu, small portions, and truly terrible restaurant service are major flaws that a five-star hotel simply cannot afford.\",\n",

So, it will be the most convenient place to stay in town for meetings (especially considering Dubai’s increasing traffic).  Also, most people are more than happy to neet at Penrose cafe inside for business meetings, if you are inviting them to join. ||Rooms are top notch within the 5 star business hotel segment; has a very good breakfast/lunch/dinner restaurant (Mina Brasserie) and is adjacent to other great restaurants like Avli & la petit maison. ||Staff & service is as one would expect from Four Seasons, and has a good cigar bar upstairs. ||Overall, if you dont need the resort type of luxury, but want something more functional & high end, this is THE place to choose in town.',\n",

We thought it was just because we had just come from outside, but even after we left the AC on and came back hours later, nothing changed. Even the telephone it’s not even working (room 604), whenever we had a concern, we called them using our cellphone. The maintenance guy came and said we had to move to another room. We transferred to another room around 10 PM. When we transferred, it was a connecting room, we can hear the next room. The bathroom was dirty, drainage in the shower area wasn’t sufficient to hold the water, so it flowed all the way into the bathroom. “I hope my concerns and those raised by others are addressed, as I’ve noticed similar comments in other reviews.

The gym and sauna are great too. Breakfast buffet was fantastic. Overall verdict: well worth the price. Can’t ask for more for the amount paid. £45 a night inc breakfast.',\n",

I also used a Smiles App “birthday week” complimentary upgrade, but the room we received felt almost the same size as the one we originally booked—the main difference was having unlimited coffee.\\n\\nThe room temperature wasn’t as cool as we preferred and couldn’t be adjusted further. On the brighter side, breakfast was decent, the pool was nice for the kids, and the staff were helpful.

The team are so lovely and friendly here and really do go out their way to help you. Manuel mentioned this will be one of the best hotel breakfasts ever and that we should get there early before it gets busy - I was very impressed by the breakfast, the choice was varied and large (but not overwhelming at the same time), excellent food quality and a really good choice of healthy foods. I’ve done a lot of the renowned hotel breakfasts in Dubai and this is easily the best breakfast I’ve done here.\\n\\nThe room was a very good size - beautifully furnished, immaculately clean and we loved our tropical green view of all the plants and trees outside. The resort feels like a green tropical oasis - it felt like I was on an island and was the perfect place to switch off. The gym is very big and might be one of the bettors gyms I’ve seen. The hotel is famous for Twiggy which we enjoyed but we actually preferred the family pool instead - it felt more peaceful, we loved the surrounding greenery.\\n\\nThe hotel has a great choice of restaurants too - Thai Kitchen is our favourite always and the hotel is also a very quick walk away from a mall if you need to get anything or want other food options.\\n\\nWe loved our stay here and would definitely come back again.',\n",

The interiors are beautiful, modern and spotlessly clean and the team were always on hand to ensure we had everything we needed. ||Breakfast was provided in the hotel restaurant every morning (via a quick golf buggy transfer provided by the hotel) with a fresh, high quality and varied buffet, alongside a delicious a la carte menu. The atmosphere in the Brasserie du Parc restaurant is calm and peaceful and the service was attentive, friendly and prompt.||If you want to work off some of the food, then the gym (according to my husband) is ‘the best hotel gym’ he’s experienced, with a great range of equipment.||Overall we had an incredible, relaxing three night stay at Park Hyatt Dubai and very much look forward to returning in the future.',\n",

There is Ansar store in front of the hotel where you can exchange your money at a good rate. There are also stores next to the hotel that sell for 1 to 15 dirhams. The lobby was super cool and clean. The breakfast at this hotel is self-service, which I commented on. Everything was great. Most of the staff are Indian, Asian, and African. They are all kind and caring, and I feel like they love their job. Everything was great inside our room. Towels, shampoo, and razors were charged. The rooms were cleaned every day, which even I was surprised by all this excellent follow-up. They gave each room a large bottle of mineral water every day. In terms of cooling, the rooms were like the North Pole. The sheets and pillows were clean. The bed was comfortable. The only problem was the hot water, which was not hot. I had no problem with it.  I was on the seventh floor. The top floor had a clean pool, a jacuzzi, and a gym, which were free. Massage was also available for a fee. Without a doubt, if I come to Dubai again, I will choose this hotel. I would like to thank all the hotel staff for making my stay and experience Dubai a good one ❤️💐🎊',\n",

To make matters worse, the hotel kept my passport as security without any prior notice finally I had to exchange it with 100 AED Cash.

This is the first time I've encountered a hotel that doesn't provide basic amenities like a kettle, a fridge, or even coffee for the guests. The bedsheets and duvet had blood stains, black marks from bed bugs, and a lot of dust—it's hard to understand how the management can allow such conditions.\\n\\nThe room was extremely dirty, and the air conditioning didn't work properly. The staff were unprofessional and unhelpful. The noise from the bar was so loud that it made it difficult to sleep. It feels like the hotel only cares about promoting its bar and spa. Even the staff at the spa were more focused on flirting and making extra money than on serving customers properly.\\n\\nThe most shocking part was discovering bed bugs in the room—this is completely unacceptable. When we wanted to cancel the booking due to these issues, we were told that the money could not be refunded. It's clear that they don't follow any proper hotel policies, and after taking guests’ money, they fail to provide even the most basic services.\\n\\nThe pictures online made the hotel look beautiful and clean, but the reality was the complete opposite. I hope the owner reads all these bad reviews and makes serious improvements to the hotel. I strongly advise anyone considering this hotel to avoid it at all costs.

No flexibility, no understanding, and no effort to accommodate parents who are clearly responsible and present.

I asked if they have a juice, only watermelon juice. okay, they have coffee, and i asked for Latte, also no, just a coffee with milk. I ordered tea with milk, she brought me a coffee with milk.

By 11:00 PM, they were compelled to shift to another hotel, which caused them considerable discomfort.\\n\\nDespite repeated attempts, we have not yet received any update regarding the pending refund. Unfortunately, our calls to Accounts, Reservations, and Front Desk have gone unanswered, which is highly unprofessional and concerning.\\n\\nAs a local travel agent in Dubai, such experiences directly impact our trust and business partnerships. At this stage, we cannot recommend Chelsea Plaza Hotel for future bookings. However, we will continue to try reaching out to your management team in the hope of resolving this matter amicably and securing the refund at the earliest.\\n\\nWe sincerely urge you to look into this issue on priority and provide a resolution.\\n\\nThanks & Regards,\\nTeam LaVista Travel LLC',\n",

       " 'Honest and open review…||This was for our honeymoon / 1st wedding anniversary so we wanted it to be special hence why after a lot of searching we decided on this hotel. We saved for 12 months for this trip too and certainly isn’t the normal place we tend to book. ||The hotel grounds / building…wow. It’s gorgeous. It’s got the tranquil, relaxing feel anyone would want for such a special trip. ||The staff are always so so friendly and always wanted to help (for someone who isn’t use to this..it was very overwhelming at first) and the team in Zest learnt our names too which is always lovely. ||The rooms..again wow, lovely and beautifully designed. ||There was a couple of things that to me for the bar that’s set & price point of this hotel that just needs small tweaks and for us made me give it a 4/5 instead of 5/5. Again maybe it’s just us as for what we were expecting given how special this trip was. |Sometimes they didn’t explain the specials in the restaurants so we didn’t know about them. We had to find where things were ourselves, no one showed us where the pools/restaurants were. |They come round with fruit / juice / cold towels round the pool but it all seems to happen between 10-11 so if you get there later in the day you miss all of that, nothing seems to be repeated in the afternoon. |We weren’t expecting fireworks or anything spectacular but we had told them it was our honeymoon / 1st wedding anniversary pre-arrival yet no one made a fuss or acknowledged it. ||Overall we had a lovely relaxing stay but given how ‘luxurious’ this hotel is suppose to be we left feeling a little underwhelmed give our expectations and reviews we had read.',\n",

The signature scent of the hotel is absolutely out of this world – subtle yet luxurious, and instantly soothing. It truly set the tone for the rest of my stay.||One of the many thoughtful touches I appreciated was the incredible shower gel – the fragrance was divine, and I was so delighted when the team kindly offered me a complimentary bottle to take home. It’s little gestures like this that make a big difference.||I also had the pleasure of being looked after by Vinu and Ishan at the bar, both of whom were exceptionally polite, attentive, and professional. They made the best margaritas we’ve ever had – perfectly balanced, refreshing, and always served with a smile. Their service made my evenings feel extra special.||Throughout my stay, every staff member – from the lobby, restaurants, and reception team to housekeeping – provided flawless service. Everyone was warm, welcoming, and genuinely committed to ensuring guests feel cared for. The cleanliness of the entire property was impeccable.||My room was stunning – incredibly comfortable, spotlessly clean, and filled with thoughtful touches. The furniture and interior design were breathtaking, combining luxury with comfort in the most beautiful way.||This was more than just a holiday – it was an experience of pure indulgence, peace, and exceptional hospitality.

Didn’t have one bad meal or qualm at all. ||Expense wise, this is Dubai…..Drinks are roughly £14 (pint) and £17-20 cocktail. Not at the cheap end, yet it is a five star hotel. Food wise, would highly recommend booking Full or Half board. There are many dining options, yet without this pre paid it could be expensive as a standard meal (2 courses and a drink) is around £65-80 per person. ||We stopped in a Premier Dulex room, cleaned and refreshed twice every day to a high standard. ||The gym is pretty good and has most machines and weights. There are two pool areas, tower one should be used for morning - tower two for afternoon. ||If there was one small issue … the hotel isn’t on a beach front and the pools aren’t the largest. To combat this your allowed to get a 5 minute bus put on by the hotel to their sister hotel the royal maridian. Large pool and beach access - a good option and it isn’t a laborious trek, litterally 5 minutes at most. ||The hotels located smack bang on the marina which is lovely for a walk, run or cycle. It’s about a 15 minutes walk to the fringes of the JBR district, and a short taxi from Zero Gravity or Obeach.

Every night, loud conversations echo through the corridors well past midnight, with guests shouting and slamming doors as if unaware others are trying to sleep. Even now—1:23 AM—the noise continues. The atmosphere is cold and uninviting, with no sense of hospitality or charm. Breakfast is as average as everything else here: uninspired, forgettable, and far from what you'd expect at a supposed four-star establishment. In truth, it barely scrapes three.

The room was comfortable and the gym was excellent, fully equipped with Technogym machines and open 24 hours. They also have a nice club upstairs called Scandal, which I visited and enjoyed.

At night it was very quiet and we did have an excellent sleep.Breakfast was great, a lot of variety for the food. Kudos to the chef who custom made my omlette order,  it turned our exactly how I wanted it.We went to the pool complex nearby, and with so many available pools there was no shortage of space.

       " 'We spent one night at the V Hotel Dubai and honestly, this hotel doesn’t deserve more than 2 stars. When we arrived, we thought we had walked into a cinema or a shopping mall. There was no proper lobby, no seating area, and absolutely no service. Nobody came to help us with our luggage – my husband had to approach the staff himself, even though we were traveling with a 10-month-old baby.||||As Hilton Gold members, we were extremely disappointed. There was no welcome gesture at check-in, no recognition of our status, and not even a baby bed provided in the room. The staff member who checked us in, Shenwe, was unfriendly and made us feel completely unwelcome. On top of that, the room was not even 100% clean. The whole atmosphere felt more like a train station hall than a 5-star hotel – totally unprofessional and impersonal.||||The only positive aspect of our stay was the Mexican restaurant. The staff there were very attentive, and the food was absolutely delicious. We had lunch there instead of dinner (even though it was supposed to be part of our half-board package), and while Shenwe told us it was not possible, we later discovered that the restaurant actually opened earlier. We ended up enjoying a wonderful meal at 4:30 pm despite her saying otherwise.||||Overall, the hotel itself was a huge disappointment. Cold, impersonal, not fully clean, and nowhere near the standard you would expect from a Hilton property in Dubai.',\n",

There was no noise, no rush, no need to think about anything. Just calm water, a gentle breeze, and a kind of attentive, quiet service that never felt rehearsed.\\n\\nWhat stood out most to me wasn’t just one thing — it was the combination. The food had real character; it wasn’t just tasty, it had depth and personality. Every dish felt considered, not generic. The drinks, too — served with care, not flash. It’s the kind of place where your drink arrives looking almost too pretty to touch, but ends up being exactly what you needed without asking.\\n\\nThe space itself is thoughtfully designed — elegant without trying too hard. But more than aesthetics, it’s the energy that makes it memorable. Unpretentious, calm, quietly luxurious. No loud music. No crowds. Just a beautifully balanced atmosphere that makes you feel like the entire day was curated just for you.\\n\\nIt’s not easy to create a place that feels this relaxed and still delivers so consistently — but Anantara Downtown does exactly that. It’s a rare kind of escape, and one I’ll absolutely return to, whenever I want the city to fade into the background for a while.',\n",

       " 'We stayed at The Tower Plaza as a family of seven, and from start to finish, it felt like the staff went out of their way to make our trip special.\\n\\nOur arrival itself showed us how caring the team is. We came in two taxis, and one of them accidentally dropped my wife and children at a spot near the hotel instead of at the entrance. Without a second thought, Zubair from the entrance went to collect them and brought them safely to the lobby. That thoughtful gesture immediately made us feel we were in good hands.\\n\\nAt reception, Thurein welcomed us warmly and took excellent care of us. He surprised us with a complimentary upgrade to bigger rooms, which was such a blessing for our large family, and even arranged a late checkout so we could enjoy our last day without rushing. It really made the stay feel relaxed and stress-free.\\n\\nThe rooms were huge — spacious enough for the kids to spread out and play, and comfortable enough for the adults to unwind. Clean, modern, and well maintained, they gave us the space we needed as a big family.\\n\\nThe food was another highlight. We had breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the hotel, and every meal was fresh and delicious. There was a good variety that kept both adults and kids happy. A big thank you to Manik and Rahul, the restaurant assistants, who were always friendly, attentive, and made sure we were never short of anything. The kids especially loved how they always greeted us with smiles and treated them so kindly.\\n\\nAnd then there’s the swimming pool — one of our favorite parts of the stay. The pool was spotless, well-maintained, and perfect for both relaxing and splashing around. The children spent hours there, and it quickly became their favorite part of the hotel. Watching them laugh and enjoy themselves made it feel like a proper holiday.\\n\\nWhat made The Tower Plaza truly stand out wasn’t just the facilities, which were excellent, but the people. From Zubair helping at the entrance, to Thurein’s thoughtful reception service, to Manik and Rahul’s warm hospitality at the restaurant — every single one of them made us feel welcome and valued.\\n\\nWe left with wonderful memories, happy kids, and a genuine appreciation for the staff who made our stay so smooth and enjoyable.

They even remembered my name which was a nice touch. ||Due to a maintenance issue we spent our first night in the executive suite which was spacious, however it was pretty dated, had a pungent smoke smell, run down sofas which stank of smoke and the lighting was really poor. It’s no wonder the hotel is renovating all of its suites as they are starting to look pretty outdated - one thing which wasn’t mentioned when we booked. Thankfully we moved the next day to the diplomatic suite which is what we had originally booked.  This room was even larger and so much nicer - we loved it. ||Despite the poor executive suite which we stayed in for one night, we didn’t want to leave this hotel as it was so good. Bear in mind the current roadworks outside of a new flyover which causes awful traffic outside the hotel at rush hour.

       " 'Hotel review ||I stayed here from September 6th - September 13th 2025 and I will put my review into a few separate sections for ease. For context I stayed as a family of 3 with 2 adults and a 2 year old from the UK and had the standard all inclusive option. ||Room |We stayed in the basic room with a city view - upon arrival we were asked if we would like to upgrade to a sea view and a bigger room but we declined. The room is spacious enough for us 3 including a cot. The bathroom has a Bathtub with a shower in which was great and was a good size. I don’t think there was enough storage available for all of our clothes and I had to double hang my clothes on the clothes hangers, but that could equally be me bringing to many clothes on holiday! |The view of the city is not bad, although extremely dusty in the distance so I could make out the city line from the lights and the burj khalifa but could not see it properly for 5 out of 7 days - the other two you could clearly see the Burj Khalifa and surrounding buildings. |The room was cleaned and bedsheets changed daily, Netra, Reagan and Sirmaya were cleaning my floor and left an animal shaped towel on our bed every day which was lovely and entertained our toddler - thank you. ||Pools|As we had a toddler we opted to stay in the splash zone which was perfect for all ages up to 4/5 - it was under cover, had plenty of things to do and kept our toddler entertained for hours upon end. We also went to the family pool which again was under cover and had water up to around 60cm deep - it is the perfect area for toddlers and had plenty of Sun loungers around. I must give a huge shoutout to Kingsley who was the lifeguard on duty, he went above and beyond every single day to speak to us and our toddler, he gave her some toys and allowing her to put toys around his seating area, he really is a fantastic asset to the staff at the hotel and made our time by the pools even more enjoyable. |There was another decent sized pool which we went into daily and the temperature was perfect, there was 4/5 lifeguards on duty which gave extra peace of mind and they all interacted with everyone and giving swimming tips and advice (even to my toddler!) |The lazy river - this was a nice and enjoyable experience which we did regularly, you can walk through if needed or if you want to push someone. |There was an infinity pool on the beach I did not visit, and a slide for children over 100cm which again we did not use, but looked great. |Unfortunately I did not go to the beach to report on that - sorry! |I must say every lifeguard was kind and would wave and say hello to everyone, they are all fantastic assets and make the swimming experience even better. ||Restaurants|There is 2 buffets which were adequate, I find that the majority of all inclusive have a good selection and good standard - nothing will blow your mind and nothing will be bad, Centara fits this category. One was an Asian style Buffett and one was a Lebanese style. ||Uno Mas (Argentinian steak) you have to pre book but is worth it, it was a great experience and one we would do again. ||Sands - a good selection of food for lunch and dinner. ||The two buffets are open for breakfast (and sands on weekends) |One buffet and sands are open for lunch |Everything is open for dinner ||Drinks |This is the biggest let down of the hotel and if anything would one thing that would stop me going back to this hotel. Now I am not talking about alcoholic drinks either, soft drinks (coke, Diet Coke etc) were not readily available.|In general there is only 2 bars you can walk up to and get a drink. One by the beach and Sands restaurant was available for drinks all day, another shoutout to Raj who was working extremely hard in the heat. |In the main building and reception area there is no bar or place to get a soft drink (water is available) which meant that on an evening I would be walking from the main building to the beach bar to get a drink and bring it back - not good enough in my opinion. |You can go to any restaurant that is open and get a drink, but you’ll need to sit down at a table and ask for it to takeaway and then wait for it to be delivered which I think is poor for an all inclusive. I have been to many similar resorts across the world and all have either refrigerators with cans in, or plenty of bars you can walk up to and get a drink. I have heard people say that you can get drinks delivered to your sun bed but from my experience you still have to go up and order from the sands restaurant. It’s only a little point , but when you are all inclusive then drinks should be the one thing you can have on demand and without hassle - I don’t believe that centra did this the best. ||Location|It is very close to the airport and in the direct flight path for Dubai airport, so you will have all different types of aircraft consistently flying above at low altitude - I personally didn’t mind this and enjoyed seeing aircraft so low and up close and the noise I got used to very quickly. It took around 30-40 minutes to get to and from the airport in a taxi, although would have been a lot quicker if there wasn’t as much traffic! ||Staff |I will say that EVERY member of staff was kind and interacted with the children very well - this was a massive positive and really enhanced the stay, not one member of staff was unhappy or rude, a fantastic selection of staff all around.||Evening entertainment|Due to being no bars easily accessible in the main reception area I did not stay and watch any entertainment although I did see entertainment daily on the evenings||Overall|It was a thoroughly enjoyable holiday, I would personally like more drink options and availability, but other than that it was a good hotel perfect for families which it is obviously catered for. Keep hold of the staff you have and improve on drink situation and it would be a top top resort. I think I would return to this hotel in the future, the staff really make this place great.|Thanks for a great stay',\n",

It was also nice to find out our room had been upgraded as we were here for our anniversary.||When we arrived in the room there was lovely bouquet of flowers, a bottle of wine and a cake which was a nice surprise.||The room was nice and clean and well equipped.||Breakfast was buffet style with lots of choice and good quality.||We were half board so had the choice of lots of restaurants.  The food was very nicely presented, our favourite was the Italian.||All the staff we encountered were really friendly and helpful.  Special mention to Suntando who was always on hand to help.||The hotel grounds are lovely with plenty of sunbeds and 3 pools to choose from. It’s is also only a short walk to the beach with further sunbeds.||I personally found the pools quite busy with music being played at all of them. It would be nice if one was adults only with no music to give choice if you wanted more peace and quiet.||I have only given 4 stars as there is a lot of noisy building work going on next to the hotel which does affect you whilst around the pools or sitting on your balcony.  Also the beach is pretty much a building site with large trucks going by. You certainly cannot relax on the beach.||The hotel is reasonably well situated but due to construction works the traffic can be very bad round the area.  One evening it took the taxi 45 minutes to get from the metro station  to the hotel which is around 4 miles.  You can walk via a footpath which is about a mile but after a day out in 42 c temp it’s quite tiring!  This is the option we had to take due to the traffic.||To recap the hotel is lovely , although busy, I would probably choose another location due to the building works and traffic.',\n",

       " 'The canal view from the hotel room was just stunning. I love it! The room and bathroom were really clean and spotless. The pillows were quite comfortable. Clean bedding and blanket. The room size was good too. The bellboy was very quick to bring up my stuff and take it to my car. The staff members checked me in and out quickly, with no hassles!',\n",

       " \"Great Stay with Some Tips for Future Guests\\n\\nMy wife and I stayed here during our trip to Dubai and overall had a pleasant experience. The hotel was clean, comfortable, and well-maintained. While we did encounter a few issues with the room upon arrival, these were mostly resolved after contacting the front desk a few times.\\n\\nOne thing to note is that food and drink prices at the hotel were quite high — we paid nearly €30 for a few snacks and two drinks. For those looking for more affordable dining options, I highly recommend downloading the Careem app. We ordered full meals for two through it and paid no more than €17 in total, with delivery straight to the hotel.\\n\\nThe breakfast selection at the hotel was excellent, with plenty of variety to choose from. Transportation to and from the hotel was also smooth and convenient using Careem.\\n\\nWe’ve saved this hotel for our next visit to Dubai, and would definitely recommend it to others — especially if you're aware of a few practical tips in advance.\",\n",
       " 'The hotel is fine for a short stay. Staff are friendly and the rooms are ok, but I wasn’t impressed overall. It feels just like Dubai – modern but lacking any real soul or charm',\n",
       " 'The Atana Hotel is not the newest hotel but you have everything you need. The staff is super friendly and responds to every request at any time and always friendly and with respect. The breakfast buffet is balanced. The rooms are simple but nicely decorated and well equipped. We had booked early and received a great price. The price-performance ratio is definitely right. We can only recommend it.\\n\\nI had a birthday during our stay. and booked a special for it, my expectations were exceeded the room was decorated with a lot of love and my birthday was so simply unforgettable. Lovely Thanks to the Housekeeping.\\n\\nIn the morning we booked a couple massage in the associated spa and also there everyone was very friendly and it was received on every request. The deep tissue massage will definitely live up to your name, unfortunately the spa room was a bit cold but also there was tried as best it was possible to work against it.',\n",
       " 'Decent Stay, But Bathroom Needs Improvement\\n\\nStayed at Atana Hotel in Barsha — overall, the hotel looks fine and the rooms are clean and comfortable. However, I was disappointed with the bathroom amenities. For a hotel of this size, I expected basic items like a toothbrush to be available, but it wasn’t provided.\\n\\nAlso, the water temperature was a problem — hot and cold water didn’t seem to work properly. I ended up having to shower with extremely hot water, which was quite uncomfortable.\\n\\nIf they can improve the bathroom setup and amenities, it would definitely make the stay more pleasant.',\n",
       " \"I stayed at the Atana Hotel in Dubai for a few days and, all things considered, I think it's a good value for money. The interior spaces are well maintained and I appreciated the presence of a pool and gym, which are great for relaxing or keeping active during your stay. However, the international buffet service was disappointing: the food quality was rather mediocre, and during peak hours, there weren’t enough tables available. Food was often cleared away before the official buffet closing time, which was frustrating. Another downside was the room cleaning service — sometimes incomplete, especially in the bathroom area where towels were frequently missing. In conclusion, I would still recommend this hotel to those looking for a simple base in Dubai for a few days, at an affordable price and in a fairly convenient location near the metro, as long as you don’t expect high-end service or quality.\",\n",
       " '⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\nI had an excellent stay at Atana Hotel. The rooms and common areas were always spotless, and housekeeping was very attentive.

       " 'I have asked guest services front reception on our first night that there was hot water only. The front guest instructed me that they would be sending someone to fix it. The next day, I took a shower, the problem was not solved, pure hot water was coming. At this point I was counting my days to leave the hotel. The third night, I come to the hotel at 12:57am, and no cleaning was done l, absolutely 0.\\n\\nThe front desk at 1am says they can cancel it and refund.\\n\\nSo at this point I’m not sure what to say.',\n",
       " 'Very good experience like always! It was our 2nd time to stay here. We hope to come again next year.. the most thing we like there is the various menu the restaurant offers. Last year we stay in Adam tower and this year Eve tower! And both are just amazing 🤩.\\nThank you for being a great and right host\\nfor our stay.',\n",
       " 'In the past, I stayed at this hotel three times; however, due to a significant decline in the quality of services, I have to check out halfway through my stay. I called three times for an iron at different times of the day and was told they didn’t have any. The pool, which according to the regulations should be open until 10 PM, is closed earlier— the lifeguard was aggressively telling everyone to leave the sunbeds at 9:45 PM.',\n",

I booked a balcony room with breakfast, and the view was just stunning (pic included)\\n\\nWhat really stood out to me though was the service, every single person was super respectful, always addressing me as “sir,” and I never once felt out of place.\\nThe room itself was amazing, quiet, relaxing, clean, nicely decorated, and the lighting made it feel cozy. The bed was really comfortable, and room service was next-level. You could order any time and they’d take care of it. Breakfast was one of my favorite parts: tons of variety and everything actually tasted good.\\n\\nThe location is perfect too. It’s literally a 2-minute walk to DMCC metro station and about 15 minutes to Marina Beach, which, by the way, is beautiful at night (pic included). The gym was small but had everything I needed, and the pool area was nice as well. I also needed to check out the meeting rooms for a potential business meeting, and the staff personally took me there and showed me around. On top of that, when I needed help removing batteries from toy cars to pack in my luggage (a random request, I know), they sent someone up right away to help. That kind of service is rare, and I really appreciated it.\\n\\nIf I had to point out areas for improvement: the Wi-Fi could be a little better, the mini fridge didn’t really keep things cold, and the TV felt a bit outdated with limited channels and no proper YouTube app, just a browser shortcut. But honestly, these were small things and didn’t ruin my stay at all.\\n\\nOverall, I absolutely recommend staying here. The staff, service, location, and breakfast were all amazing. I’ll definitely be coming back.',\n",

       " 'I recently stayed at this hotel with my 2-year-old baby, and while the staff were friendly and the welcome was warm, unfortunately, the overall experience did not meet my expectations.\\nTo start, the room was not properly maintained — I found spiders and bugs throughout the space, including near the bed, which was very concerning considering I had a toddler with me. This raised serious safety and hygiene concerns, and it was quite disappointing to see such issues in what is supposed to be a high-end resort.\\nThe food prices were also extremely high and definitely not justified by the quality or variety offered. For a resort experience, I expected better value and options.\\nRegarding transportation, the transfer boat does not have air conditioning, which is a major issue during the UAE summer heat. The lack of AC made the ride uncomfortable, especially with a small child. Additionally, the boat schedule was very limited and inflexible — I strongly recommend offering more frequent and convenient timings for guests.\\nAlthough the island concept sounded appealing, it wasn’t as impressive in reality. I’ve visited other similar island resorts in the region and had far better experiences in terms of cleanliness, facilities, and atmosphere.\\nOverall, while I appreciate the friendly staff and warm welcome, the issues with cleanliness, safety, food pricing, and transportation made the stay fall short of expectations.',\n",

There were no towels provided for the floor or for hands, only one bath towel per person. The tissue in the room was already used and wasn’t replaced with a clean one. We also only received one pillow each, and when we asked for an extra pillow, we were told it wasn’t possible because the hotel was busy.

       " 'We stayed at this hotel as a couple for our honeymoon, but unfortunately, the overall experience was disappointing for a 4-star property.\\n\\nYes, it is the tallest hotel, but beyond that, it didn’t live up to our expectations:\\n•\\tThe rooms looked just like the pictures online, but not in a good way – the photos make them seem larger and more appealing than they actually are.\\n•\\tOur room had a kitchen, but it couldn’t be used due to fire regulations. Staff confirmed that ovens and stoves are prohibited, which makes us wonder why they are even there. The fridge worked, but still, it felt misleading.\\n•\\tThe bed and bedding were uncomfortable. The sheets unfolded easily and did not meet the standard we would expect from a 4-star hotel.\\n•\\tThe bathroom was also underwhelming. The bathtub was much smaller than shown in photos, and the lighting was very dim and yellow, making it difficult to get ready or do makeup.\\n•\\tBathrobes and slippers were not provided, even after requesting them several times.\\n•\\tThe TV had no internet access, so no YouTube or Netflix – only local channels, which was very limiting.\\n•\\tThe lifts were a constant frustration. With only 2 elevators serving guests, we regularly had to wait more than 20 minutes just to leave the hotel.\\n•\\tBreakfast was very poor. Staff were rude, food was often cold, coffee and juices were not fresh, and the bread seemed old – definitely not what you’d expect from a hotel at this level.\\n•\\tThe swimming pool itself was nice, but timings were very restricted. Families with kids were mixed in with couples, so it wasn’t relaxing.\\n•\\tTo enjoy the rooftop view, you must book the restaurant before 3 pm – otherwise, you’re not allowed access, which feels unfair for guests.\\n•\\tReception staff were sometimes moody and made us wait for basic questions. On the ground floor, there are vendors selling perfumes and other items, which can be uncomfortable when you’re not in the mood to shop.\\n\\nOverall, as frequent travelers, we had much higher expectations for our honeymoon stay. Gevora Hotel ended up being more about the view than the experience. Service and amenities need significant improvement to truly reflect a 4-star standard.\\n\\nWe hope management takes these points seriously – not to offend, but to help make future stays much better for other guests.',\n",
       " \"We have just arrived back from the most amazing stay at the Gevora Hotel,\\nThe breakfast service and food were great. Plenty of choices and options and would go above and beyond every morning to make sure you had what you wanted.☺️\\n\\nDuring the day, we had food by the pool and opted to buying the children's meals as these were a very good size portion! Again, the food was lovely.❤️\",\n",
       " 'A Memorable Stay with Exceptional Service\\n\\nI recently stayed at Gevora Hotel, and I must say, the experience exceeded all expectations. From the moment I walked in, the staff made me feel welcome, especially Atul at the reception desk, who truly went above and beyond.\\n\\nAtul was incredibly professional, warm, and attentive. He not only made the check-in process smooth and pleasant, but he also surprised me by upgrading my room to one of the top floors with a stunning view of the Burj Khalifa. That view alone made my stay unforgettable – watching the city lights at night and seeing the sunrise over Dubai from such a height was magical.\\n\\nThe room was clean, spacious, and well-equipped with all the amenities I needed. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was spotless, and the housekeeping staff ensured everything was in perfect order throughout my stay.\\n\\nThe hotel’s location is excellent – right on Sheikh Zayed Road, close to the metro and just a short drive from major attractions like Dubai Mall and Downtown. The rooftop pool and restaurant also offer spectacular views of the skyline, making it a great.',\n",

He ensured that we had a beautiful room with a \"Burj Khalifa\\' view and also ensured that the rooms were allocated to us as early as possible.||Gevora Hotel is in downtown at Sheikh Zayed Road, and the location is the highlight as the metro station is within walking distance. Not to mention that the Museum of the Future is also within walking distance.\\xa0 ||The breakfast is delicious with a variety of dishes to satiate every taste bud of different cultural backgrounds and food habits. The breakfast had everything that one could ask for, and the food was delicious. The smoothie was my favorite. Thanks, team, for serving us such a grand breakfast.||The hospitality of the hotel was super great and the staff was just a call away to any request that we made.

The moment we walked into the hotel, we felt completely at ease and were relaxed at the warm hospitality of the concierge staff who immediately took our luggage while we were busy completing the check-in formalities.|The room provided to us was super spacious, and it was a delight to be in the room for 5 nights. The housekeeping staff was very prompt and efficient, too!||I am thankful to each one at the Gevora hotel for making our stay comfortable and memorable. Highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for luxury and value for money.||The downside is, of course, the lifts, as they are too small to cater to such a big hotel with a large number of rooms and high occupancy. Otherwise, everything was awesome.||Thank you, Gevora Hotel, and once again, special thanks to Al Amin. I hope you get 5 stars from your Manager for your courtesy, smile, and warm hospitality! I asked about you on the day of our check-out as I did not see you after our check-in. I wanted to thank you in person. Nonetheless, you made our stay memorable - All the best to you!',\n",
       " 'In summary, the Gevora Hotel offers an unbeatable location and magnificent views, which are significant draws. However, guests should be aware of potential issues with worn room furnishings and a somewhat underwhelming breakfast experience. While the staff addressed the bathroom leak efficiently, the incident itself points to maintenance areas that could be improved. For Travellers prioritizing location and views above all else, the Gevora Hotel remains a viable option, but those seeking a flawless, modern, and comprehensive luxury experience might consider other alternatives.',\n",

During my stay, I experienced several serious hygiene problems:\\n•\\tThe refrigerators were completely filled with ice.\\n•\\tThe beds were infested with bugs and bedbugs.\\n•\\tWhen taking a shower, the water leaked all over the bathroom floor.\\n\\nAfter my stay, I developed bites and rashes all over my body. At first, I thought they would heal over time and used cream, but unfortunately, they have not gone away. In fact, the problem is spreading further, and I believe I was infected during my stay at your hotel.\\n\\nOn the first day, I reported the issue to the reception. The receptionist told me they could change the room and replace the pillows. However, this solution did not help at all.\\n\\nIn addition, several hotel staff members repeatedly told me things like: “We will buy you a coffee, just write a good review about us and mention my name.” I never did this, but such requests are clearly unethical and place undue pressure on guests. ❗️❗️',\n",

During my recent checkout, I politely asked if I could leave a small medical pillow here until my next stay which was only 4 days away. The staff member refused and, when I asked to speak to a manager, he said he was the “duty manager” and that there was no one above him.\\n\\nWhat struck me was not the refusal itself, but the dismissive and ironic attitude in which it was delivered. For a hotel that caters to repeat business guests, this kind of unhelpful and rude response is unacceptable. Hospitality should be about finding solutions and treating guests with respect, not shutting them down.\\n\\nThis experience left me extremely disappointed, and I rated it as 1 simply because I couldn’t choose zero. Kindness and respect should come before anything else in hospitality. In my home country, we give lessons in hospitality, so such behavior is unacceptable and frankly disgraceful. The attitude I was shown was nothing short of appalling. I strongly urge management to bring in staff with basic manners and training. I will also be taking this further by sharing the full details publicly on social media, including the individual’s name.',\n",

       " 'I rarely leave reviews, but I feel compelled to share my experience after such an unacceptable stay at this hotel.||From the moment I arrived, it was clear that customer service was not a priority. The staff were not only unhelpful but, at times, outright rude. I was treated with a complete lack of respect and courtesy, which is not only disappointing but also completely unacceptable for any hospitality business. Mind it i have been staying here for over 15 years & always respected the place as a family house but i started noticing that the quality of staff along with the hotel has gone down and the only desk which is helpful was concierge. ||What made matters worse was the blatant disregard for the hotel\\'s own policies. I approached the booking team before the arrival and usually as a GOLD customer i get good rates for an executive suit but this time i was surprised that the rate they booked me on was higher then what it was on booking.com and agode and when i complained the team had no answer and started saying we will compensate next time.|||The room was not ready at the scheduled time, and when I finally got in, it was far from the clean, comfortable space advertised. Several basic amenities were missing, and despite multiple requests, no action was taken. It honestly felt like I was being treated as an inconvenience rather than a guest.||During my last day i had multiple guest visits & everytime i used to recieve call they would get an approval and send the guest upstairs but it surprised me that one of the reception guy named \"Ashraf\" called in an said that you need to come down to take ur guests despite they had provided the ID etc, he said it was rule that you must come down or they will wait untill you come. i asked that if this is the policy why i was sent the guest without me there to pick them up & why all of a sudden this became the policy where he was quite rude in response that i dont know what others have been doing but i will only send them if you are here otherwise dont waste the time.||To top it all off, management was nowhere to be found when issues escalated. No one took ownership rather this guys behavior was like a warrior ready to attack. It\\'s incredibly frustrating to pay for a service that not only fails to meet expectations but also leaves you feeling disrespected.||I strongly advise others to think twice before booking here. There are plenty of other options where you\\'ll be treated with the professionalism and decency every guest deserves. This experience has ensured that I will not be returning ever, and I hope this review helps others avoid a similar disappointment.',\n",

       " 'I really love this hotel. Excellent service at reception from Jeffrey and Tobias, and the food at the restaurant is absolutely delicious. Chef Ganesh and Anup provide such warm and attentive service, and the waitresses, especially Thiri and the rest of the team, are very kind. The only exception is Sabanha, who always seems to have a very negative attitude, as if she’s unhappy with her life. Hopefully, she considers looking for other job opportunities, because she always serves with a frown and unwillingness. A smile is free maybe she could try that. Honestly, she’s the only downside. The rest of the staff is an excellent team.||I stayed here because my son is studying at Amity University, and I’m sure I’ll be returning to this hotel soon.',\n",
       " 'Very good hotel with nice friendly staff apart from one girl on reception who was rude. But we booked half board with a promise of 8 to 10 resturants to choose from. There is only 5 . Which wasnt upsetting but abit of a false promise . The beach bar was under construction and also the room lobby carpets smelt funny which wasnt welcoming. I will return as the food and drink and staff where all great. Also if your going book half board. Make sure you book half board PREMIUM and you can have 2 hours unlimited drinks when eating at their resturants . A big money saver right there :)',\n",
       " 'Stayed 13th - 17th Sep. Work going on which means not much space for sun loungers around the one pool or beach but the staff do their absolute best to find a space for you.

This is our 5th visit back to this hotel and we will keep coming back.',\n",
       " \"Atiq and the other staff were very helpful and hospitable. The hotel was modern, convenient, great location and I loved  my loft-suite. Only reason I didn't give the rooms 5 stars is that the elevator service is extremely slow, especially if you're on the high floors (40-43) and I think there may have been some water damage that was being repaired as there were commercial floor fans in the lobby and the smell of moisture/mildew in the hallways of the lower floors.\",\n",

You feel like you are bothering them.\\n Cleaning staff is very nice. \\nBreakfast is not varied enough. What they serve is good but it s not varied enough. No freshly squeezed juices.

Which, although we were ‘All Inclusive-Plus’, reduced the number of A La Carte restaurants that we could attend down to 3, excluding White Orchid and Kinara which are paid extras. Perhaps an alternative option could have been provided until Taperia re-opens. However, this did not impact our stay, as both Sette and Republik are perfect for dinner.||A special mention to Martin, who looked after us every day at the beach, making our beds up and always going over and above without hesitation. It’s been a pleasure to get to know Martin both this year and last during our previous stay.
